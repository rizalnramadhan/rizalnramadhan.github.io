[A General Summary]  
2023  
3D-printed PLA, water, salt, Artemia eggs

In A General Summary - titled after a poem by Rudyard Kipling - I paired a 3D-printed, 3D-scanned ancient human footprint from the site of Engare Sero, Tanzania, with Artemia (brine shrimp or "Sea Monkey"). Water and dormant Artemia cysts were placed into the recess of the footprint, transforming it into a small, ephemeral pool that mimics the organism’s natural habitat. Artemia eggs can remain in stasis for years in dry conditions, a survival mechanism that mirrors the fossilized footprint’s own suspended history. Together, they form a quiet dialogue between two resilient organisms: one persists through dormancy, the other through proliferation - eventually rising to dominate the Earth.
