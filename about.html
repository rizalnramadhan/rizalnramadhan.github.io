Rizal Nugraha (b. Semarang, 1994) studied Fine Arts at Institut Teknologi Bandung and graduated in 2017. Originally based in Bandung, he is currently pursuing his studies at HBK Braunschweig, Germany. His practice explores the intersection of digital processes, material transformation, and temporal traces, often working with generative algorithms, 3D printing, and organic matter. Drawing from geological time and thermodynamic principles, his works reflect on how traces of ancient life persist in contemporary materials—whether in plastic remnants or computational energy consumption. His practice also investigates the entanglement of human and non-human agency, technology as an extension of life, and the blurred boundaries between natural and artificial systems.
